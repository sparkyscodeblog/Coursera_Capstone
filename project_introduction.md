## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to help people moving into a new area. Primarily aimed at people moving
into a area permanently. This information will be categorised into areas like amenities, transport etc. 

The exact categories will depend on the data available from FourSquare API and other data sources. 

Then each area can be compared using these different categories. 

Initially here is a list of some of the metrics I will use.
- house prices 
- Distance from motorway
- bus routes
- nearest train station
- nearest supermarket
- nearest cinema
- nearest post office
- nearest park 
- nearest swimming pool

- nearest/number of high schools
- nearest amazon locker
- number of taxi firms trading in this area
